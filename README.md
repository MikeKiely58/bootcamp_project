# bootcamp_project
This is a web application aimed at improving users understanding of UK Government national annual expenditure. The front end will permit users to make changes to the national expenditure across 120 sections. The back end will be a database of the current 10 Departments NSO and their budegts for 2019-2020. The front end allows users to make changes to the national budget by section and the application will calculate the cost to the changes.
The proposed expenditure will be displayed to show the impact or need to increase/decrease Government income.
