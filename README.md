This is a web application aimed at improving users understanding of UK Government national annual incomce and expenditure. The front end will permit users to make changes to the national expenditure across 10 departments. The back end will be a database of the current income and expenditure using NSO and HMRC pusblished data for 2019-2020. The front end allows users to make changes to the national budget by department and the application will calculate the impact on national debt.
The income and expenditure must balance and thus this field will be common to botj.
